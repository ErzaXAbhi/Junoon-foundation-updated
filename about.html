            <p>
              Junoon Foundation, a brainchild of a group of young,energetic and
              dynamic go-getters, is a non-profitable organization working
              towards the betterment of society. Junoon Foundation is a
              <nobr>Palghar-based</nobr> <nobr>non-profitable</nobr> organization working in the education
              sector. Junoon Foundation started its journey in April 2013. In
              the short span of a few years, Junoon has touched many lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Junoon aims to tap into people's inner potential and innate
              talents through education, awareness, training and guidance, and
              help them progress in life. We try to achieve this through our
              various initiatives held throughout the year. At present, Junoon's
              focus is on the rural underprivileged society but it wishes to
              spread its wings much beyond as it grows in stature and strength
            </p>
            <h2>Vision:</h2>
            <p>
              Junoon aims to spread happiness and prosperity in the society
              through education, social awareness and sustainable development.
            </p>
            <h2>Mission:</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Education:</strong> To impart life skills and soft skills,
              provide career guidance and encourage the love for arts and sports
              among children.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Social Awareness:</strong> To spread awareness regarding
              education, health, hygiene, government policies, social
              responsibilities, tolerance and unity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> Junoon is trying to preserve the fast depleting cover of trees and vanishing jungles. We organise tree plantation drives, and hold rallies to create awerness among citizens about the importance of nature and sustainable agriculture.
            </p>
            <h2>Initiatives:</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Go Green:</strong> India has a diverse ecosystem. But the country's forest cover is fast depleting due to industrilization and felling of trees for commercial use. We need to put a stop to this if we want to survive as a species; Junoon foundation's Go Green is a small step in the same direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Joy of Giving:</strong> Every year Junoon foundation collects school material and donates it to the needy students. We conduct this event as part of India's biggest donation festival. We ran a social media campaign called 'Gift-a-Notebook' on our social media platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Saptarang:</strong> Our aim is to create interest among the children for arts/craft and extracurriecular activities while having fun at the same time. We taought students to make scince toys and explained the principles behind the. We took work shop on safe/unsafe touch as part of sex education.
